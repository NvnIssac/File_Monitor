Assumptions from my side for execution:
1) The API file name has been assumed to be API_JSON.json and another file with  API_JSON.json.bkup exists in system previously.
2) Printing the messages to console output related to JSON modifications.
3) My scripts and JSON file exist in same path. [Enhancement: Json location can be changed and validated, by changing the json paths from current directory search to os.walk search across all directories in my file_compare.py script]

Prerequisites required:
pip install watchdog

How to Execute the Script:
On Terminal run the below command:
python python monitor_file_changes.py <Path>

-->Path argument is optional, if not specified it searches for any json modifications from "." directory structure.
--> If we modify our API_JSON contents, automatically the monitor script communicates to file_compare.py to validate and print the changes to console output.
